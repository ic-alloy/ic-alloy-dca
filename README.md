# DCA Agent example

This Dollar Cost Average agent runs on an interval specified by the user to swap
a set amount of in tokens to some out tokens. The agent runs as a smart contract
on the Internet Computer and swaps ERC-20 tokens using Uniswap.

The backend consists of a Rust canister uses the
[ic-alloy](https://github.com/ic-alloy) library to interact with the Ethereum
blockchain. The frontend is built with React and Vite.

## Setup

There are two main ways to set up the dev environment:

### 1. Using a VS Code Dev Container

The dev containers extension lets you use a Docker container as a full-featured
development environment. This repository includes a dev container configuration
that you can use to open the project with all the necessary tools and
dependencies pre-installed.

Pre-requisites:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Dev Containers Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)

Once Docker, Visual Studio Code and the Dev Containers Extension are installed,
you can open the project in a container by clicking the button below:

### 2. Setup manually

Pre-requisites:

- [Local Internet Computer dev environment](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/backend/rust/dev-env)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)

Once you have the prerequisites installed, you can clone this repository and run
the project.

## Running the project

### 1. Start the Internet Computer

```bash
dfx start --background
```

### 2. Deploy the evm-rpc canister

```
dfx deploy evm_rpc
```

### 3. Deploy the DCA canister

The backend canister is deployed using a script. Edit the deploy script to
change the default values.

Default values:

- owner: "$(dfx identity get-principal)"
- token_in_address: "0x1c7D4B196Cb0C7B01d743Fbc6116a902379C7238"
- token_in_name: "USDC"
- token_out_address: "0xfff9976782d46cc05630d1f6ebab18b2324d6b14"
- token_out_name: "WETH"
- fee: 3000
- amount_in: 100000
- slippage: 5
- interval: 3600

```
bash scripts/deploy-backend.sh
```

### 4. Deploy the frontend

```
pnpm install
dfx deploy frontend
```

## Usage

### Transfer tokens to the agent

Before you start the agent, you need to transfer some tokens to the agent canister, both the "in" token and
some of the base chain token to pay for the gas fees. The agent Ethereum address is displayed in the frontend.

### Start the agent

```bash
bash scripts/start.sh
```

### Stop the agent

```bash
bash scripts/stop.sh
```
### Check the agent status

Access the agent status by visiting the frontend canister URL.

### Transfer tokens from the agent

```bash
bash scripts/trasfer-in-token.sh
bash scripts/trasfer-out-token.sh
```

## Develop

During development, you can run the frontend with hot reloading using Vite.

```bash
pnpm run dev
```
